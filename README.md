# Get Together

Get Together is a web application for easy and comprehensive party planning. It could also be used as an event planner, if the need arises. Maintained by me solely, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/igrgurina" target="_blank">Ivan Grgurina</a>.

It was started by a team of 4 as a Infinum Student Hackaton project, but the others quit :( and I liked the idea so much I decided to keep going and add (new) features as the time allows me.



## Used Technologies:

* Twitter Bootstrap
* JQuery
* AngularJS (in the future)
* ASP.NET - Razor (in the future)

### Notes:

I'm writing most scripts and styles in the same file as the markup, as I'm still trying to decide how the app should look like and everything can change in the matter of minutes
